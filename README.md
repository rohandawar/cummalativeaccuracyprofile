CAP popularly called the ‘Cumulative Accuracy Profile’ is used in the performance evaluation of the classification model. It helps us to understand and conclude about the robustness of the classification model. In order to visualize this, three distinct curves are plotted in our plot: 

A random plot
A plot obtained by using a SVM classifier or a random forest classifier
A perfect plot( an ideal line)
